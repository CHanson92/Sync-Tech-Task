# Sync Tech Task

This was a technical task that I did where I had to create a server in Express where I could send and retrieve data from a database.

## To use

Install everything with <code>npm i</code>. Then use <code>npm run watch</code> and ensure that MongoDB is running using <code>mongod</code> and <code>mongo</code> where the database used is called 'sync'.
